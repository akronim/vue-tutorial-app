<!-- Configuring Lazy Loading 

The most useful is the "loading" property, which specifies a component
that should be shown to the user while the asynchronous component is loading, 
and the "delay" option, which specifies the delay before the loading component 
is shown to the user and ensures that the user doesnâ€™t see the loading message 
for operations that complete quickly.
