    the results of most getters are cached.
    A getter function receives two parameters: state and getters.

    The getters function can be used to combine results of other getters, thereby allowing us to build more complicated results in smaller portions.

  /* 
    The only way to change the value of the store is through a mutation. A mutation consists of a string type 
    and a handler function. 
    One way to think of the type is that itâ€™s like the name for the handler. 
    The handler is a function that accepts at least one parameter, state, and can have a second parameter 
    called payload. If multiple values need to be passed to the mutation, we can use an object.
    Since every mutation is logged to track changes, all mutations must be synchronous. 
    If a mutation needs to perform an action that is asynchronous due to using a callback or promise, 
    the logic should probably be moved to an action.

    To invoke, or call, a mutation, we call commit on the store object. When we call commit, we can pass it 
    the type, or name, of the mutation to call and a payload, or we can pass it an object that has a property 
    named type. The rest of the object will be the payload.

  /*
    An action can be asynchronous. Any task that might require a callback or a wait period such as calling 
    a server should be an action.
    When the asynchronous task is done, we will be able to call commit with the results. This will preserve 
    the transaction history of our Vuex and still allow us all those fun calls to servers.
    Actions follow the same format as mutations with a string type, or name, and a handler function. 
    
    The handler function accepts two parameters: context and payload. The context parameter contains 
    the same properties and methods as the store does in a mutation, allowing us to access the state 
    and commit mutations.
    To call, or invoke, an action, we follow the same format as when committing a mutation, 
    except we call dispatch on the store.
