// To allow NPM to run the json-server package, add the statement:

// add the package that we will use to make HTTP requests
// Axios is a popular library for making HTTP requests in web applications
// npm install axios@0.18.0

// MAKING CROSS-ORIGIN REQUESTS
// By default, browsers enforce a security policy that only allows JavaScript code
// to make asynchronous HTTP requests within the same origin as the document that
// contains them. This policy is intended to reduce the risk of cross-site
// scripting (CSS) attacks, where the browser is tricked into executing malicious
// code.
// Two URLs are considered to be in the same origin if they have the same protocol,
// host, and port and have different origins if this is not the case.
// The URL that we use for the RESTful web service in this chapter has a different
// origin than the URL used by the main application because they use different
// TCP ports.
// The Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) protocol is used to send requests to
// different origins. With CORS, the browser includes headers in the asynchronous
// HTTP request that provide the server with the origin of the JavaScript code.
// The response from the server includes headers that tell the browser whether it
// is willing to accept the request.
// The json-server package that provides the RESTful web service supports CORS
// and will accept requests from any origin, while the Axios package that we use
// to make HTTP requests automatically applies CORS.
// When you select software for your own projects, you must either select
// a platform that will allow all requests to be handled through a single origin
// or configure CORS so that the server will accept the applicationâ€™s requests
// for data.
